# SQL Challenge
This SQL challenge has 3 parts:
Data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.

## Data Modeling
In this section, you will find an image of a sketched Entity Relationship Diagram of the 6 CSV files that were provided as starter files.

## Data Engineering
In this section, I used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the 6 CSV files, and I imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
In this section, I created the following 8 queries:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
